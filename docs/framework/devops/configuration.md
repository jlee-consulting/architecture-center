# Configuration for DevOps

## Monitor and update machine configuration

Use Azure Automation State Configuration to provide configuration management required for enterprise environments.

## Schedule deployments

Employ Update Management to manage VM updates in Azure, on-premises, or in other cloud providers.

## Monitor resource configuration

Use Azure Advisor to follow best practices to optimize Azure deployments and analyze your resource configuration and usage telemetry.

## How do you deploy, manage, and monitor a solution as a group rather than handling its components individually?

Use Azure Resource Manager to define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.

## Repeated deployment of resources

Utilize Azure Resource Manager deployment modes to provision all resources specified in the template.
