# Regulatory compliance
Cloud architecture has fundamentally changed the responsibilities of operating an IT service. This shift can introduce challenges when strictly applying these standards to cloud workloads. Good security practices like those described in this document frequently align well to the established security recommendations and requirements in these standards. Some recommendations in standards are more difficult to adapt to the cloud because some outdated security practices wonâ€™t sufficiently protect cloud workloads. Additionally, focusing too much on outdated approaches can divert resources from more effective modern protections.

**What do the law, authorities, and regulators require?**
***
Governments and other organizations frequently publish standards to help define good security practices so that organizations can avoid negligence. The purpose and scope of these standards and regulations vary, but the security requirements typically influence the design for data protection and retention, data privacy, and system security. 

Because of these potential challenges and the potential fines or other business impact of noncompliance, we recommend working with your regulators and carefully reviewing the standards to understand both the intent and the literal wording.
